#can we deal multiple providers at a time..?
yes


#provider
terraform has multiple providers ex: aws,azure,gcp,github etc
every provider has version 
if provider version not provided it will take latest version

# you have same provider(aws), u have 2 aws accounts or multiple regions,and u want to create resources in both the accounts or regions, how do u deal with it..?
using alias, need to add alias to resource

#diff btw refresh vs import

#map
this comes in for each loop

#in terraform class i remember one of the learner had asked that instead of dev state file knowingly or unknowingly pointed to prod state file, since we had backend as s3, will there b possible to restore the statefile,would it possible to restore..?
sol- versioning or cross region replication
